<p>The &quot;Dragonfly&quot; stems for a desire to go back to the beginnings of the web, when things were simpler. Back then, sites were created and uploaded as HTML and editing in a text editor required a knowledge of the underlying codes.</p>
<p>Since that time, the drive to make things simpler for the end user has made things more complicated under the hood. This can also mean that for a simple site, the end user has to learn more than is needed to get the job done.</p>
<p>To go back to basics, or rather, start with a clean slate, code was written fresh, without relying on a pre-built solution, but learning from it.  That is the experience working with a fully fledged content management system was there. This included Joomla!, Drupal and WordPress, the most extensive experience of which has with WordPress.</p>
<p>In other words, one shouldn't assume that broad useage means that a platform ought to be used in all situations. Some reasons for not wanting to do so is that increased complexity means increased cost in real dollars, time and frustration. A simple platform that can be built once and left alone, without updates, will be much more user friendly in the long run than one that is constantly updated in the background and that is demonstrated to break functionality or change it's underlying structure, even when this is not needed for the site in question.</p>
<p>Thus the focus here is on the person launching the site, running the site, maintaining the content for the site and paying for server costs.  The implementation of the underlying code is secondary.  The end result is that less than 500 lines of PHP code are used, the entire page is less than 5 KB, including CSS, no javascript is used, thus making everything more secure and the page load times are less than half a second, actually closer to a third of a second.</p>
<p>If anything happens to the underlying code set or if it needs to be reviewed, this can be done in just a few minutes. The tradeoff for this emphasis is that there are no or few built in  bells or whistles. However, since the time that the web has been launched and today, there are plenty of third party bells and whistles that can be added by merely copying and pasting snippets of code. This includes videos from Youtube and Vimeo (which provide the complete snippet for the iframe as well as just the short code). The same goes for Google maps.</p>
<p>In addition, Disqus provides commenting functionality for the same, as well as share functionality.  Thus, going back to the roots, while incorporating functionality added by others during the past twenty years allows one to attain the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Finally, this tiny little platform is licensed a bit less restrictively than the 20MB behomoth that WordPress has become, with the MIT license, instead of the GPL license.  It uploads quickly. I didn't finish counting to ten before the source code finished uploading.  And there is no MySQL database, reducing server costs even further. Much simpler.</p>
