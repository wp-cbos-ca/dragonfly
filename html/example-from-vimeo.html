<p>The procedure is almost the same for Vimeo, select "Share" (which is the paper airplane at the top right of the video when you hover over it), then "Embed". You can adjust the settings there by choosing "Show Options" and then adjusting these below the video shown. Then copy and paste the code into the text you are editing. The underlying code for Vimeo would look something like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/140596026" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
<p>&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/140596026">Comparison and Contrast Between 3D &amp; 4D Thinking&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/user42955909"&gt;Clarence Bos&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.</p>&gt;</code></p>
<p>Please note here that additional information is included automatically by Vimeo. I don't always like that in place, so may remove it.</p> 
<p>The video rendered would look something like this:</p>
