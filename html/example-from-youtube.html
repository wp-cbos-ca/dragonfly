<p>In order to show a video from Youtube, select "Share", then "Embed". You can adjust the settings there by choosing "Show More". Then simply copy and paste the code into the text you are editing. I prefer this method as you can see exactly what you are getting, without the need for a cumbersome code base. Thus the underlying code would look something like:</p>
<p><code>&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6vs3-2gdGc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>
<p>and the video rendered would look something like this:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6vs3-2gdGc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
